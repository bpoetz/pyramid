Web Services Wiki Tutorial
=======================================


This tutorial will explain how to use pyramid to build a web service that consumes and produces JSON.
We will build on the example given in the SQL alchemy tutorial.  We will assume you have already completed this tutorial.

For cut and paste purposes, the source code for all stages of this
tutorial can be browsed on GitHub at `docs/tutorials/wiki_web_services/src
<https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/tree/master/docs/tutorials/wiki_web_services/src>`_,
which corresponds to the same location if you have Pyramid sources.
